# Advanced_Chi_Square

This test answers following questions;
Question 1: Does the term of the loan influence loan status? If so, how?
Question 2: How has the ability to own a home changed from 2007 to 2011?
Question 3: The news just ran a story that only 15% of homes are fully paid for in America, and that another 10% have given up on paying it back, so the bank has "charged off" the loan. Does it seem likely that the data for this hands on came from the larger population of America?
